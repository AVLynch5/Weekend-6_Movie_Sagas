# Movie Sagas

## Description
_Duration: 2 day sprint_

Do you remember going to the movie theater and just standing outside the building, staring at the posters lining the walls?  Welcome to Movie Sagas, an app designed to help users collect and track movie information with a visual aid! Using the app, the user can store movie information like title, genres, description, and a picture. Use it to list movies you want to see, movies you own, or movies you have seen!
